# Pickstone-development

This repository contains R code for processing, analysing and
visualising the data presented in "Improving Predictions of Canopy
Height in Tropical Forests with Machine Learning" by Brianna Pickstone
under the supervision of Dr Andrew Cunliffe and Dr Hugh Graham for her
MSc in Applied Data Science (Environment and Sustainability) at the
University of Exeter in partnership with Permian Global.

**This repository contains the following scripts:**

*Preprocessing.R* This script contains code for pre-processing both the
LiDAR data and optical data. This includes generation of the canopy
height model, calculation of topographic metrics and calculations for
the vegetation spectral indices from the optical data.

*Intial_Plots.R*

*Spatial Autocorrelation.R*

*MLR.R* main script for undertaking multiple linear regression for
prediction of the canopy height model

*RF.R* main script for undertaking multiple linear regression for
prediction of the canopy height model

*CNN.R* main script for undertaking multiple linear regression for
prediction of the canopy height model

*Minimum LiDAR.R*
